   2. Young professionals/ Students/ Office People face trouble finding home-made food.
  
##Overview

   1. A platform that bridges the gap between home chefs who want to step into the food business but don't have enough resources to run a restaurant, and consumers who want to eat      light, delicious & nutritious food that reminds them of their homes.
   
   2. Used AstraDB to store information about the users, data about nearby Kitchens, their Menu, and their order details
    
##Goals:

   1.  There has been a considerable emergence of remote and centralized kitchens, with a changing market. It provides the easiest method for users to get the best services according to their needs.

   2. A big database of local information in different regions.
   
##Scalability:

   1. We plan on developing an Android application too for our platform, to increase the user base.
